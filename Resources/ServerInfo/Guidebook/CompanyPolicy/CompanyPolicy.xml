# Self-Defence

NanoTrasen prioritizes the safety and well-being of all individuals aboard its space stations, including employees and patrons. The company recognises that maintaining a secure environment is essential to operations, and, in light of this fact, all NanoTrasen employees are authorised to exercise their right to self-defence when confronted with an imminent threat of physical harm or violence upon their person.

This is a clear demonstration of our unwavering support for your safety and well-being, under these guidelines:

The threat must be immediate and serious, with clear intent to cause grievous harm or injury to the employee.

Before resorting to self-defence, the employee must have exhausted all reasonable alternatives for avoiding or escaping the threat - including following established protocols, attempting de-escalation, and seeking assistance from security personnel.

The response to the threat must be proportional to the level of danger posed; that is, the employee must only use the force necessary to protect themselves from harm.

The employee’s primary directive is to ensure their own safety. Once the opportunity to escape arises, or the threat is neutralised, the employee must cease their use of force and immediately seek assistance from security personnel, medical staff, and any other relevant authorities.

In any situation where an employee exercises self-defence against any individual aboard the station, they must provide a detailed account of the incident, including the circumstances immediately prior, to their immediate supervisor, security personnel, or station administration, where applicable and at their earliest convenience.

[bold]The authorization for self-defence is an exceptional measure intended to address extreme situations where no other viable options exist and only to facilitate a secure environment that fosters collaboration, innovation, and mutual respect between NanoTrasen’s employees.[/bold]

# Conduct Unbecoming

NanoTrasen personnel found to behave or act in a way that is broadly considered or specified by superiors as inappropriate, unacceptable, or contrary to our company’s standards and expectations for their position or profession, particularly in a professional capacity or when representing the company as a whole, may be demoted from that position or profession, have their contract terminated, or be otherwise reprimanded for their unbecoming conduct.

Behaviour that violates our company’s values and policies, our employees’ character, integrity, and suitability; additionally, improper conduct reflects poorly on our management. As such, [bold]Departmental Heads[/bold] are [italic]fully authorized and encouraged to demote employees who discredit our company’s values through poor behaviour and demeanour.[/italic]

# Appearance Standards

As a NanoTrasen employee, you are expected to wear provided clothing and keep it clean, well-maintained, and appropriately fitted. This ensures that you represent our brand in a professional manner and maintain the safety of yourself and others in the station environment. 

## Uniforms and Attire

Wear the uniforms and attire provided to you by NanoTrasen. Take care of your clothes, and wear them with pride. Additionally, in Sector Floof, there are a variety of different clothing tailor-made for the department. It is acceptable to wear these, so long as the individuals for that department remain identifiable. 

## Grooming

Maintain high standards of personal hygiene and grooming. Neat hair and well-kept appearances contribute to a professional atmosphere and boost first impressions. 

## Accessories and Personal Items

Limit the use of accessories that might interfere with safety equipment or delegated tasks. Personal items should be stored in designated spaces to avoid clutter and ensure your and your coworkers' safety. 

## Personal Protective Equipment

Wear the appropriate PPE as required by your role, any safety notices, or instructions from authorities. The safety of our employees and customers is paramount. 

## Respect and Consideration

When expressing yourself and your personal style, be mindful of others’ cultures, beliefs, and other qualities. Your behaviour and actions should respect the sensitivities and beliefs of others. Additionally, it should be noted that any accessory, item of clothing or apparel, or other cosmetic possession that promotes or depicts obscene or hateful content, criminal or terrorist groups, or illegal and unethical acts is unacceptable for our employees to wear. Failure to uphold our company’s values by violating this rule will result in disciplinary action. 

# Dangers from our Competitors

In our spinward stations, there exist threats from direct competitors to NanoTrasen. Conglomerates of companies, crime rings, and terrorist cells known for their unscrupulous practices, including the use of fear tactics, criminal methods, and corporate espionage to undermine and disrupt the operations of legitimate entities such as NanoTrasen. Their activities pose a significant danger to the safety, stability, and success of our stations and the company as a whole. Their motives range from obtaining valuable technology and proprietary information, to sabotaging critical systems, to directly attacking crew.

Identifying saboteur agents can prove challenging, as they often operate covertly and blend in with the station’s population. However, there are certain behaviours and indicators to be on the look-out for: 

## Unusual Interest

Individuals showing an excessive interest in sensitive research, proprietary data, or operational reasons without a legitimate reason may be potential corporate agents. Inconsistent Backgrounds Agents may provide inconsistent or fabricated personal or professional backgrounds, making it important to verify credentials through proper channels. Secrecy and Isolation Suspicious individuals may isolate themselves, avoid interactions, or engage with only select individuals or parties, raising concerns about their true intentions. Sudden Change in Behaviour Drastic changes in behaviour, such as displays of aggression or secrecy, could signal involvement with hostile groups. (edited

To combat the presence of hostile entities, crew are advised to:

  * Report suspected individuals. Increase monitoring and patrols.
  * Identify unauthorised access attempts and potential breaches.
  * Secure critical data.
  * Conduct regular emergency drills.
  * Perform de-escalation training.
  * Implement advanced counter-espionage protocols.

Should any person or party aboard a NanoTrasen vessel be found to be currently affiliated with, or in the present employ of, any hostile company, crime ring, or terrorist group, they are to have their employment with NanoTrasen terminated where applicable, be stripped of any gratuitous access, and have any corporate property on their person or possession confiscated and returned to relevant station personnel. Such persons or parties may be heavily scrutinized by Station Security forces until they, or their remains, can be remanded to the custody of their employers, an independent port or vessel, or other local jurisdiction, at the earliest convenient time and at no expense to the company. 

## Hostile Corporation Technology

Additionally, due to the presence of our competitors and their agents in the sectors in which our company operates, there is an ever-present possibility that hostile parties' technology or other property may manifest aboard our station by any number of means. The presence, acquisition, and distribution of such items should always be investigated and scrutinized heavily, and if [bold]Space Law[/bold] and local legal ordinances allow, held securely, confiscated, and restricted from use.
